  # Step 1 - build App, create Docker image and save in Docker Hub

      # dockerfile: Dockerfile --> In this step the Dockerfile will provide the JAR fie to create the Docker Image

    # Step 2 - Get the image from Docker Hub, build a AWS EC2, run the image on AWS on port 8080
#  deploy:
#    needs: build

#    steps:
#      - name: Pull Image from docker hub

#      - name: Delete old container
#        run: sudo docker rm -f spring-boot-app-container
#      - name: Run Docker Image
